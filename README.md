_"If you could work in any field, what would it be? Even if you're unsure, describe the type of impact you'd like to have."_

### Stage 3: Values & Motivation

_"What values matter most in a career for you? For example: creativity, security, helping people, etc."_

### Stage 4: Work Style

_"Do you prefer remote work, teamwork, solo deep work, or something else? Describe your ideal workday."_

### Stage 5: Long-term Vision

_"Where do you see yourself in 5‚Äì10 years? What achievements would make you proud?"_

# In app/core/config.py
ai_requests_per_minute: int = 10
ai_requests_per_hour: int = 100
ai_requests_per_day: int = 500
max_conversation_length: int = 50
max_message_length: int = 2000
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### AI Prompt Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Content filtering for inappropriate requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Timeout protection for AI API calls

### Data Protection

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration
- CORS configuration
- SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy

### Rate Limiting

- Per-user request limits
- Redis-based tracking (production)
- Graceful degradation when limits exceeded
