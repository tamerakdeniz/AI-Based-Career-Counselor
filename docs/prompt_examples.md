## üí¨ Chat Interaction Prompts

### Technical Guidance

**User Message:** "I'm struggling with understanding React hooks. Can you explain them in simple terms?"

**System Prompt:**

```
You are an AI career mentor helping a user with their Software Engineering roadmap.
The user is currently working on "Frontend Framework: React" milestone.

Context:
- User is a beginner in software development
- Learning style: Hands-on projects with video tutorials
- Currently learning React as part of full-stack web development
- Goal: Get a junior developer job within 6 months

Provide a clear, encouraging, and practical explanation. Include:
1. Simple explanation of the concept
2. Why it's important for their goals
3. Practical examples or analogies
4. Next steps or practice suggestions
5. Encouragement related to their progress

Keep the tone supportive and motivating.
```

**AI Response Example:**

````
Great question! React hooks are like special tools that let you "hook into" React's features from functional components.

Think of hooks like electrical outlets in your house - they give you access to power (React features) wherever you need it. Here are the main ones:

**useState** - Like a memory box that remembers things:
```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// count remembers the current number
// setCount changes it when you want
````

**useEffect** - Like a smart assistant that does tasks at the right time:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs when the component loads
  console.log('Component is ready!');
}, []);
```

**Why hooks matter for your goal:**

- Modern React development relies heavily on hooks
- Junior developer interviews often ask about them
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand

**Next steps:**

1. Practice useState with a simple counter app
2. Try useEffect to fetch data from an API
3. Check out the React docs interactive examples

You're doing great! Understanding hooks is a key milestone in your React journey. Once you master these, you'll be writing React like a pro! üöÄ

Would you like me to suggest a specific practice project to reinforce these concepts?

```

### Career Guidance

**User Message:** "I completed my first milestone but I'm worried I'm not learning fast enough. Should I skip ahead?"

**System Prompt:**
```

You are an AI career mentor providing guidance to a user on their career development journey.

User Context:

- Just completed "Foundation: HTML, CSS & JavaScript" milestone
- Goal: Get a junior developer job within 6 months
- Time commitment: 20 hours per week
- Learning style: Hands-on projects with video tutorials
- Experience level: Beginner

The user is experiencing common learning anxiety. Provide:

1. Reassurance about their progress
2. Explanation of why each milestone matters
3. Encouragement to trust the process
4. Specific advice about pacing
5. Motivation to continue

Be empathetic and understanding while maintaining focus on their goals.

```

**AI Response Example:**
```

I completely understand that feeling! It's actually a great sign that you're eager to progress - it shows you're motivated and committed to your goal. üåü

**Here's the reality check you need:**

- Completing your foundation milestone in 4-6 weeks is RIGHT ON TRACK
- Skipping ahead would be like trying to run before you can walk
- Every junior developer job requires solid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills

**Why the foundation matters:**

- 80% of web development problems stem from weak fundamentals
- Interview questions often test basic concepts
- React (your next milestone) builds directly on JavaScript knowledge

**You're actually ahead of many career changers because:**
‚úÖ You completed a full milestone
‚úÖ You're thinking strategically about your timeline  
‚úÖ You're staying committed to your 20-hour weekly schedule

**My recommendation:**
Continue to your React milestone as planned. The skills compound - each milestone makes the next one easier and faster.

Remember: 6 months might seem long now, but you're building a career that could last decades. Quality learning now = faster progress later.

**Quick confidence booster:** Can you build a simple webpage from scratch now? If yes, you've already come further than you realize!

Ready to tackle React? You've got this! üí™

    required_fields = ['title', 'description', 'field', 'milestones']
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in response_data:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required field: {field}")

    # Validate milestones
    if len(response_data['milestones']) < 3:
        raise ValueError("Roadmap must have at least 3 milestones")

    for milestone in response_data['milestones']:
        milestone_fields = ['title', 'description', 'estimated_duration', 'skills']
        for field in milestone_fields:
            if field not in milestone:
                raise ValueError(f"Milestone missing field: {field}")
```

### Chat Response Validation

**Content Safety Check:**

```python
def validate_chat_response(response_text):
    # Check length
    if len(response_text) > 1000:
        return False, "Response too long"

    # Check for appropriate content
    inappropriate_keywords = ['unrealistic', 'impossible', 'give up']
    if any(keyword in response_text.lower() for keyword in inappropriate_keywords):
        return False, "Inappropriate content detected"

    # Check for actionable content
    action_words = ['try', 'practice', 'learn', 'build', 'start', 'continue']
    if not any(word in response_text.lower() for word in action_words):
        return False, "Response lacks actionable advice"

    return True, "Valid response"
```

### Quality Metrics

**Response Quality Indicators:**

- **Relevance**: Addresses user's specific question/context
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand for the target experience level
